  storyText: 'Festers. Festers everywhere. They are mostly armed with gas-powered
    rock flingers. At least 10 of them are guarding the hangar door. Typical.


    I could try punching my way through all of them. Or I could sneak to the emergency
    exit -- but it would take a while.


    What should I do?

    1. Take them head on - rush the 10 guards.

    2. Sneak my way to the emergency exit.'
